# Typing-game
Following a tutorial to develop a typing game. Modifying it to target Kindergarten level standards, with letter matching, sightwords (Journeys) and sightword sentences. Instead of timing typing capability for ending the game, the game ends when the list runs out and records the time to type as the score.
