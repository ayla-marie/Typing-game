# Typing-game

Based off of the tutorial for typing-game from bradtraversy.

A typing game intended to target kindergarteners to help them learn to math upper and lower case letters on the keyboard, type their sightwords, and type basic sentences using a capital, spacing, and a period.

Modifications were made in times, scoring, and the levels were shifted from decreasing available time to changing the array of words that are presented to the gamer.
