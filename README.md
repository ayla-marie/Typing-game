# Typing-game

Based off of the tutorial for typing-game from bradtraversy.

A typing game intended to target kindergarteners to help them learn to thier upper and lower case letters on the keyboard, type their sightwords, and type basic sentences using a capital, spacing, and a period.

Modifications were made in the timer, scoring, and the levels were shifted from decreasing available time to changing the array of words that are presented to the gamer.

Sightwords sourced from Journey's Florida reading series.
Leveling based upon over 10 years of personal experience assisting teachers in grades K-2nd and 8 months personal experience teaching Exceptional Education Students in grades K-3rd.
